# MED-Net
Multiscale Encoder Decoder Network (MED-Net) for semantic segmentation of Confocal Microscopy images

The technical details of the initial version of the algorithm was presented at MICCAI'18 conference @ Granada with title: [A Multiresolution Convolutional Neural Network with Partial Label Training for Annotating Reflectance Confocal Microscopy Images of Skin](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00934-2_33). A preprint version is available at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02213)

The model and the code is also used to generate the results presented at our more recent paper titled "Utilizing Machine Learning for Image Quality Assessment for Reflectance Confocal Microscopy" that will be published at [Journal of Investigative Dermatology](https://www.jidonline.org/). The paper link will be made available soon. 

We will make the model and the corresponding code available to public after the paper the technical paper explaining the algorithm will be published.
